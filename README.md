# sdfibm
An immersed boundary method (IBM) implementation for simulating fluid-solid interaction and particle-laden multiphase flows.

-----------

# Installation
Requirement: `g++` with `C++11` support and OpenFOAM v6. Other compilers weren't tested but should work.

*Step 1*, follow the official [guide](https://www.openfoam.org) to install OpenFOAM v6. **Test** to ensure a working installation (e.g., by running the cavity case in serial and parallel).

*Step 2*, whether on your laptop or HPC cluster, execute three commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChenguangZhang/sdfibm.git
cd sdfibm/src
make
```
The last line compiles the solver binary `./src/sdfibm`. It is recommended that you soft-link it to a system-wide path (e.g., `sudo ln -s ~/sdfibm/src/sdfibm /usr/local/bin/sdfibm`), then you can run `sdfibm` in terminal without specifying its complete path.

## Important!

- Coordinate system convention: your screen is the $x$-$y$ plane, with $z$-axis pointing at you.

- For 2D simulation, create a one-cell thick 3D mesh. The "thickness direction" must be in $z$ and the $z$-span of the mesh must be $[-0.5,0.5]$. The reason is the computed force on the solid scales with the $z$-span. Set `on_twod` option in `solidDict` to 1.

# Included examples
Cases under the [example](./examples) folder are some good starting points of using the code. That include

- 2D "flow past cylinder" at $Re=200$ (animation below)

![Re200](./figs/flow_past_cylinder_re200.gif)

- the Taylor-Couette flow with a rotational core. A MATLAB finite-difference script is also there, which solves a reduced-order PDE that validates sdfibm

- an ellipse that wobbles and settles in a rectangular container

- `./examples\sedimentation` is a case where 100 circular particles settle in a square container (a video version you can pause is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6U9X9zatz8).

  The particle trajectories below clearly show the circulation caused by the counter flow.

## Creating planes

The plane definition (e.g., in the sedimentation case) can be a bit confusing, especially its orientation. We know a plane is specified by an on-plane point $\boldsymbol p$ (`pos` below) and a direction $\boldsymbol n$.  $\boldsymbol p$ does not matter much as long as it's on the plane. Regarding $\boldsymbol n$, our convention is that **it points into the fluid**. By default (i.e., no rotation or translation), the plane is the $x$-$z$  plane (like the flat ground), with $\boldsymbol n$ pointing upward, so fluid is above the plane. 

If we want to make a left wall---meaning the fluid is to its right---then $\boldsymbol n$ must be point rightwards, which in turn means we need to rotate the plane clockwise 90 &deg, or -90 &deg (I believe everybody agrees that clockwise rotation has a negative angle). Similarly, to make a right wall we have to rotate it positive 90 &deg. Lastly, if the left wall is at, say, $x=-10%$, you also need to set the `pos` variable to $(-10, y, z)$. Remember, the only requirement of `pos` is that it is on the plane, so $y$ and $z$ values do not really matter here.

# Smooth VOF Initialization

Not directly related with immersed boundary method, a tool is created to smoothly initialize the phase field of VOF simulations. The word "smooth" here is essential when simulating low Capillary number flows. The simplest method (as used by `setFields`) that simply sets the phase fraction at mesh cells to 0/1 creates a staircase phase interface, which generates capillary waves that pollute the simulation easily. My tool initializes the VOF phase field accurately and smoothly. The image below is the initialized field of the (2D) `./tool_vof/example` case, which shows

1. the various shapes can be used
2. the shapes can overlap each other (see lower right)

![vof](./figs/vof.png)

The case is ready for `interFoam` and can be run right after initialization. The result is below. As expected, the droplet oscillations are smooth without anything spurious.

![vof](./figs/vof_ani.gif)

The animation below compares smooth (left) vs. staircase (right) initializations, using the oscillation of inviscid 2D elliptical droplets ($T=1$). The left one used our VOF tool, the right one used `setFields` of OpenFOAM---there the spurious capillary waves caused by the staircase boundary are clearly visible. Even those waves appear diminished later on, they are hard to control or separate from the physical results. Thus, the left simulation is strongly preferred.

Lastly, the tool works with arbitrary polyhedron meshes, see figure below (left: current too, right: `setFields`, contoured value: 0.5).

# Extracting sampling location on the solid surface

Initially I thought about writing locations from sdfibm, but actually ParaView contour can do the same thing. It is also more flexible, because you can specify the contour value to slightly offset from the real solid surface.

Here are the steps for 2D cases.
- First, read only the front surface. In case you don't have a separate front patch, you can create a slice of the 3D volume.
- Second, apply the "Contour" filter. Certainly, it should be contoured by As and a reasonable (single) contour value is 0.5.
- Third, apply the "ExtractSurface" filter.
- Fourth, from the menu, File -> Save Data ..., choose csv format. ParaView will ask you to choose the data to save. The final output will contain the xy location of the contour and the data (such as U, p, etc.) at those contour locations.

Cheers.


# Code files

- `libshape` contains shape definitions using SDF
    - `ishape.h` the virtual base class all shapes inherit from. It also contains many SDF transformation and Boolean utilities
    - `shapefactory.h` implement the factory design pattern, it holds a library of shapes that are used in the `SolidCloud` class
    - `template.h` a heavily annotated template for creating new shapes, place to change are marked by `CHANGE`
    - `circle.h` a circle of radius $r$
    - `ellipse.h` an ellipse of radius $ra$ and $rb$
    - `kernel.h` legacy code for volume fraction calculation in square/cubic Cartesian mesh
- `libmotion` contains motion constraints. A rigid body has six degrees of freedom (linear velocity in $x$, $y$, $z$, and angular velocity in $x$, $y$, $z$), correspondingly many of the file names contains six digits of `[0,1,2]`. The convention is: 0 if the DOF is killed, 1 if it is free (i.e., unconstrained), and 2 if the DOF is prescribed.
    - `imotion.h` the virtual base class all motions inherit from.
    - `motion01mask.h` generic 0-1 mask of the degrees of freedom. It largely supersedes other files whose name contains 01 strings.
- `libcollision` for collision detection, currently only sphere-sphere and sphere-plane
- `solidcloud.h (.cpp)` the main class. It holds record of all solids and is responsible for reading the input, creating the shape/motion/material library, interacting with the fluid, and storing data into the `cloud.out` output file
- `solid.h` corresponds to the individual solid. It keeps and updates the kinematic and dynamic information of a solid. It also holds pointers to shape/motion/material instances obtained from the corresponding libraries in the `SolidCloud` class.
- `main.cpp` implements the projection method and the direct forcing IBM

# Output file
Information of the solid bodies is written to the `cloud.out` file, which has the simple plain text format: if there are $m$ solids and $n$ planes, each time step `sdfibm` writes $m+n$ lines, and each line contains 19 columns.

> names = ["t", "x", "y", "z", "vx", "vy", "vz", "fx", "fy", "fz", "EulerAx", "EulerAy", "EulerAz", "wx", "wy", "wz", "Tx", "Ty", "Tz"]

In words, they are:  
> Time, position-x, position-x, position-z, velocity-x, velocity-y, velocity-z, force-x, force-y, force-z, Euler_angle-x, Euler_angle-y, Euler_angle-z, angular_velocity-x, angular_velocity-y, angular_velocity-z, torque-x, torque-y, torque-z
